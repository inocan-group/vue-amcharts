# Sankey Diagrams

<Description of={SankeyDiagram} />

A Sankey Diagram is a special kind of chart type, used to depict branched, multi-level flows of values. Below is a very useful amCharts documentation:

- [amCharts - Anatomy of a Sankey Diagram](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/chart-types/sankey-diagram/)

## How to compose a Sankey Diagram

Unlike most charts/diagrams, the `SankeyDiagram` is the parent component and it _does not_ use any _series_ components. So that means, in it's simplist and non-composable form you can just add the following and you'll be done:

```html
<sankey-diagram :data="myData" />
```

<Preview>
  <Story name="SankeyDiagram" inline={true}>
    {{
      data: () => ({
        dataset: [
          { from: 'A', to: 'D', value: 10 },
          { from: 'B', to: 'D', value: 8 },
          { from: 'B', to: 'E', value: 4 },
          { from: 'C', to: 'E', value: 3 },
          { from: 'D', to: 'G', value: 5 },
          { from: 'D', to: 'I', value: 2 },
          { from: 'D', to: 'H', value: 3 },
          { from: 'E', to: 'H', value: 6 },
          { from: 'G', to: 'J', value: 5 },
          { from: 'I', to: 'J', value: 1 },
          { from: 'H', to: 'J', value: 9 },
        ],
      }),
      components: { SankeyDiagram },
      template: `
    <div id="story-container" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;">
      <sankey-diagram 
        :data="dataset" 
      />
    </div>
  `,
    }}
  </Story>
