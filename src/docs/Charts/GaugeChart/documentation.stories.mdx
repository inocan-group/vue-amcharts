# Gauge Charts

<Description of={GaugeChart} />

"[A] Gauge chart is used to display all kinds of one-dimensional progressive values. It can use colored bands, hands, and combinations of to display multiple values and their relation to a numeric scale/range."

Please refer to [amChart's documentation](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/chart-types/gauge-chart/) on gauge charts for more details.

## How to compose a Gauge Chart

A gauge chart consists of the following elements:

- At least one axis component
- Optionally one or more `ClockHand` components

Unlike most charts/diagrams, a `GaugeChart` is unique in that it doesn't use any data at all. In it's simplest form it just requires one axis specifying the range of the chart.

Technically any axis type can be used, but since you would usually want to display a value relative to some range of values a `ValueAxis` is the most common axis type to be used with gauge charts.

```html
<gauge-chart>
  <value-axis :min="0" :max="100" />
</gauge-chart>
```

You don't have to specify a dimension on the axis. It'll assume the `x` dimension by default. Think of the gauge chart as a one dimensional type of chart. Only in this case the axis forms an arc instead of being a straight line.

This of course doesn't convery any information by itself so you'll need to add at least one `ClockHand` component, which can be used to indicate a particular value on the radar face:

```html
<gauge-chart>
  <value-axis :min="0" :max="100" />
  <clock-hand :value="60" />
</gauge-chart>
```

## Params

Below are some useful parameters for creating and configuring a gauge chart.
