# SliceChart

"Slice charts are used to illustrate some stepped process. With each steps the total initial value is gradually reduced or increased to make the impact of the step more prominent, than it would be possible with other relational types, like, say, Pie chart."

Please refer to [amChart's documentation](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/chart-types/sliced-chart/) on sliced charts for more details.
