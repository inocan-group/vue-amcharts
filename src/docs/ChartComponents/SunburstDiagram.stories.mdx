# SunburstDiagram

"Sunburst Diagram is a circular chart that is used to indicate hierarchical relational data. It resembles nested donut charts, with an exception that Sunburst does that in a hierarchical fashion, e.g. children slices comprise whole value of their parent slice."

Please refer to [amChart's documentation](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/chart-types/sunburst/) on sunburst diagrams for more details.
