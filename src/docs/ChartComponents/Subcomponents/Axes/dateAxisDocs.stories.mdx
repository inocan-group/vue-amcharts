# DateAxis

<Description of={DateAxis} />

"[A] Date axis is quite similar to the Value axis, except instead of numeric scale, it uses date and time scale."

Whenever you have a series that is bound to date/time values in a dataset, you will need a Date axis to plot it on.

A date axis offers the following conveniences:

- It will automatically select its scale based on the actual scope of date/time values in data.
- It will also ensure that each data point is placed at exactly the position it has its date/time set on.

Please refer to [amChart's documentation](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/concepts/axes/date-axis/) on date axes for more details.
