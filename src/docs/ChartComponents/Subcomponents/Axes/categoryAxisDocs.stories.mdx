# CategoryAxis

<Description of={CategoryAxis} />

"[The] Category axis is the simplest of the axes. It does not do any calculations, or scales. All it does is list text-based items, or as charting community calls them - categories."

Please refer to [amChart's documentation](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/concepts/axes/category-axis/) on category axes for more details.

## Binding categories to data

An important setting which is needed and only used by category axes is the `category` setting. It indicates to the axis which particular field in the dataset
holds category names.

So given the following dataset, you'll need to assign the string 'category' to the `category` prop of the axis.

```json
[
  {
    "category": "Research & Development",
    "value": 3.5
  },
  {
    "category": "Marketing",
    "value": 6
  },
  {
    "category": "Distribution",
    "value": 6.5
  }
]
```

While it may be obvious to the user that the `category` field holds the category, it isn't as obvious to the chart. Moreover, that field could have any other name
depending on the dataset so you'll need to explicitly indicate it to the category axis.

## Params

Below are some useful parameters for creating and configuring a category axis.
